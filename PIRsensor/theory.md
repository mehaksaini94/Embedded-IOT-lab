PIR = (Passive Infrared Sensor).

PIR sensor detects a human being moving around within approximately 10m from the sensor. This is an average value, as the actual detection range is between 5m and 12m.PIR are fundamentally made of a pyro electric sensor, which can detect levels of infrared radiation. PIR sensors are incredible, they are flat control and minimal effort, have a wide lens range, and are simple to interface with.
